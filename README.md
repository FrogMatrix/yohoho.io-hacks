### How To Hack
1) Open the console (Ctrl + Shift + J (Windows, Linux) or Command + Option + J (macOS))
2) Copy and Paste the code from [index.js](https://github.com/eunhyobenjaminkim/yohoho.io-hacks/blob/main/index.js) to console
3) The console may redirect you to 'Sources', make sure your in the 'console' tab, and enter.
4) The site will reload. Make sure to close the console. If it takes too long to load, try reloading again. This may happen on the first time.


### Important
 - Must close console after reload
 - Must not be logged in
     - If you want to save it to your account, must run code first, then login to a new account
